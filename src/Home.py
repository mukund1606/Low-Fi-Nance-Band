            - We faced many challenges while scraping chatGPT to generate lyrics as chatGPT is not a static website so we had to use selenium to scrape it.
            - Next we had challange taking video input from the user and then processing it to create a virtual experience of playing instruments.
                - For this we used WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) to take video input from the user and pass it to the OpenCV to process it.
            - Next, challenge was to create sounds of the instruments. For this we used PyGame library to play sounds.
            - And, at last, we had challenge to combine all the parts together to create a single project.
                - For this we used streamlit to create the front-end of our project.
